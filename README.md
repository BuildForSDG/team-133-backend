## About


Here’s how our model works:
Market:We offer an online markert for our registered farmers by linking them to buyers directly and hence remove exploitors effect.
Farm Inputs. Farmers receive high-quality seeds and fertilizer from our registered providers at a most convinient price, . 
Delivery. We deliver inputs to locations within walking distance of every farmer we serve.This is through the use of our registered transport agencies or drivers.
Training. Farmers receive training throughout the season on modern agricultural techniques.This will be through online videos and planned events in colaboration with our partners in each region.
Market Facilitation. We offer crop storage solutions and teach farmers about market fluctuations, so that they can time crop sales to maximize profits.
Land renting:We also showcase a list  of land for rent for the farmers so as they can move to large scale farming and increase production rate
Every link in this chain is important—if one is missing, then the others won’t have as much impact. We provides all of these services together, enabling farmers to significantly increase their incomes and build paths to prosperity.


## Why
For small scale farms following problems are seen mostly:

Lack of market for the products
Input supplies and materials is less as that of large scale farms
No substantial production, the products are limited to self consumption only.
Targetted programs by the agencies and government might not be accessed to small scale farmers as they might have small land holdings.
Exploitation from middlemen.
Lack of vetirinary and crop scientist services
These are some of the problems that we solve.
This is a SDG goal 2(ZERO HUNGER) project and addresses Problem Statement 1
'Build a solution that can help to double productivity for small scale food producers in your community. This solution could be financial or allow them access opportunities, bigger markets etc.'  
The project is important because:
Increasing biodiversity. By growing heirloom and other non-commercial varieties, small farms bolster biodiversity and increase food security. With only 12 plants and five animal species making up 75 percent of what the world eats, food systems are vulnerable to natural disasters and disease outbreak.


## Usage
User triggers a request to the web server over the Internet, either through a web browser or the application’s user interface
Web server forwards this request to the appropriate web application server
Web application server performs the requested task – such as querying the database or processing the data – then generates the results of the requested data
Web application server sends results to the web server with the requested information or processed data
Web server responds back to the client with the requested information that then appears on the user’s display

## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the `__tests__' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
